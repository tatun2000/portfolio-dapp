# üìÇ portfolio-dapp

This project demonstrates interaction between a **Portfolio Owner** and an **Organizer** (a company or employee).  
It is built with **Next.js**, **wagmi/viem**, and integrates **IPFS via Pinata** for storing event data.

## User Story

The application has **two roles**:

- **Owner** ‚Äì creates event requests
- **Organizer** ‚Äì reviews and confirms/rejects those requests

To use the app:
1. Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
2. Choose whether you act as **Owner** or **Organizer** by connecting with the appropriate wallet.

### üë§ Owner Workflow
- Creates a new event request.
- Each event includes metadata stored on **IPFS** (via Pinata).

- **Confirmed** events become certificates visible to the Owner.  
- Each certificate contains a `contentURI` pointing to IPFS data.  
- Rejected events also include a `reasonURI` explaining the rejection.
